# WeatherApp-MVVM-
A little weather app. Trying to understand MVVM architecture. Source code is not mine. 
More than 85 % of it was taken from here -> https://www.raywenderlich.com/6733535-ios-mvvm-tutorial-refactoring-from-mvc.
If you do not understand something from this project, follow this link and read the original article.

I was learning this architecture with help of that article and this code. Personally, I made some changes, add 2 new fields, but in general its the same.
Oh, also i got rid of the stack view, and replace all elements with auto layout constraints.
